# Rucker
***This is a KOOK robot SDK implemented in pure JavaScript, which means that you don't need to install anything else (such as node.js, Jquery) to be able to use this SDK, of course, if you write TS we don't support, please go to the SDK at [next door](https://github.com/fi6/kBotify), they support ts.***

# Get updates
***Don't worry, we rarely update, and if there is, you will definitely notice it first (after all, it is true that we update after a long time)***

# Notes
- **After downloading, you need to unzip the compressed package before you can use it!**
- **If you need to use all the APIs, you only need to import the index .js file (of course, you can also introduce them one by one)**

# Pros of Rucker

* **Use Ajax for crawling and requesting without relying on third parties.**
* **Only using JavaScript, there is no need to worry that some features of TS will not be used**
* **Low resource footprint (mainly due to no dependency on third parties)**
* **With both SDK and command framework mode, you can write a bot with a single line of code.**
* **Perfect API and stable iteration allow you to focus on development without worrying about the SDK.**
* **Powerful interactive features that make it easy to complete a variety of complex functions that require a lot of interaction.**
* **Both webhooks and websockets are supported (but they are not mixed, otherwise serious bugs will occur!)**
