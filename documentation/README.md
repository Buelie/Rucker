#### Usage
***If you need to use all the API interfaces, just import the index .js file (otherwise you will be exhausted), the code is as follows:***
```javascript
import 'Rucker/index.js';
```
***If you need to use the Features API, you only need to import the Main .js files in a specific folder, e.g.***
```javascript
import 'Rucker/Bot/Main.js'; //Introduce robot-related interfaces
import 'Rucker/api/Main.js'; //Introduce APIs
```

# Get updates
***You can check the tag, you can get the version you need from there, if you find that there is no version you need (the version that the author himself admits exists, but it cannot be obtained in the tag) please contact the author Buelie, and the author will reply within 7 working days.***
